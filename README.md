Abstract
The git folder contains the source code for the hands-on tutorial providing a step-by-step procedure to design & develop a typical 3-tier microservices based application that finds use in a hybrid cloud environment, where the core data center application leverages IBM Cloud services and runs on an OCP cluster. 

The tutorial could also be leveraged as a starting point to modernize data center applications in a multi-cloud environment.
It demonstrates how to integrate IBM Cloud services, viz. IBM Watson Assistant and Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB with containerized applications on OCP on Power.
